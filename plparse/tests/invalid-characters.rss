She is the Host of the new iTunes Podcast Show Fit 2 Love: Physical, Emotional and Spiritual Fitness for the Happy Life You Deserve which is six day a week video and audio show.</p> <p>What sets JJ apart from her Celebrity Fitness counterparts is the holistic approach to getting results. Over the last fourteen years she has studied, used and applied Positive Psychology, Neuro-Linguistic¬† Programming (NLP), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Law of Attraction, Quantum Physics, Non Violent Communication, Imago Therapy, and Hypnotherapy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="Style18">Affectionately known as ‚ÄúThe Kindness Guy,‚Äù Michael J. Chase is a bestselling author, inspirational speaker, and one of today‚Äôs most powerful voices for creating a kinder world. In 2007 he founded The Kindness Center, and is now¬†considered an expert on the subjects of kindness and positive behavior.¬†As a world-renowned leader in personal and spiritual development, Michael¬†reveals how living from the heart plays a critical role in healing our lives and our planet.</p>
<p class="Style18">In addition to teaching the importance of humankind-ness, he offers proof that within our challenges lie great opportunities for growth and service toward others. Despite a family history of substance abuse, violence, depression, and suicide, Michael chose a different path, spreading positive energy throughout the world.</p>
<p class="Style18">Whether presenting in a classroom, boardroom, or on stage in front of thousands, his message of hope impacts countless lives each year. In 2010, Michael joined the Hay House speaking roster, which includes self-empowerment legends Louise L. Hay, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Christiane Northrup, Marianne Williamson and many more. He has since been a main presenter at Hay House conferences throughout the US and Canada.</p>
<p class="Style18">Michael‚Äôs work is not aligned with any particular belief system ‚Äî his teachings are based on the universal language of kindness, which embraces all and excludes none.¬†He has writen two bestselling books on this subject and is currently working on his third, with an expected release date in 2015.</p>
<p class="Style18">Before becoming an author and inspirational speaker, Michael was an award-winning photographer and co-owner of Chase Portraits. From 1991-2007 he specialized in high school senior portraiture and was one of New England‚Äôs most sought after photographic artists.</p>
<p class="Style18">When he is not traveling, Michael spends his time in southern Maine with his loving wife and four-legged best friend, Mollie.</p>
